        <h4> founded by Late Padmabhushan Dr.Karmveer Bhaurao Patil in 1919,
                     is one of the leading educational institutions in Asia. 
         The contribution of the Sanstha in the field of education is great.
                         It laid stress on the education of the downtrodden, 
             the poor and the ignorant which is the major bulk of society. 
             Karmveer Bhaurao Patil was man of masses who devoted 
             all his life to the cause of their education. 
             He was visionary and realized the dire need of education.
             He believed in education as a means to eradicate the social evils such as illiteracy,
             untouchability, caste-hierarchy, money lending, superstitions and social and economic inequality,
             All his life, he tried to translate this belief into reality.

       The name "Rayat" conveys the unprivileged, the educationally handicapped, and the disadvantageous ones.
        Karmveer developed a motto "Education Through Self Help". 
        He brought many promising children from rural area to Sanstha and shaped their lives to be the men of social 
        status. From the time of establishment, the Sanstha has produced seven Vice-Chancellors, thousands of 
        doctors, political leaders, agriculturists, industrialists, scientists and devoted teachers.

        
        The Great Banyan tree as symbol used by Karmveer Bhaurao Patil is really remarkable. It is an enormous tree with its tentacles. 
        It gives shadow to the people resting under it, the tentacles that come downward touch the soil again which reflects the bridge
         between the sky and the soil. It advises the people in Rayat not to forget the soil while dreaming of sky-high aims.
        
        Considering the extraordinary work done by Rayat Shikshan Sanstha in the field of mass education and in social field, 
        especially for the people of down trodden section; scheduled caste, scheduled tribes and nomadic tribes, since 1919, 
        the Government of Maharashtra, the Central government of India and some social organizations have appreciated the work by awarding 
        following prestigious awards.

    S. M. Joshi College is run by the Rayat Shikshan Sanstha, Satara, which was established with the aim of imparting education to the downtrodden masses. It was founded by Late Padmabhushan Dr. Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil in the year 1919, with a vision and mission to educate the children of downtrodden and deprived class and from remote area. He wanted to inculcate the dignity of labour among the students along with the social, spiritual, cultural and human values. He was a visionary who knew education only can eradicate all the social evils. So he established the schools, colleges in inaccessible area which was neglected by the educationists. The number of branches of Rayat Shikshan Sanstha reflects his vision and mission being translated into reality. He brought many promising children to Sanstha and shaped their lives to be the dignity in the society through to go abroad for further studies. Hence by nurturing the values of self help and dignity of labour, the mission statement is reflected.
